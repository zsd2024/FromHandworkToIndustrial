# Core
block.from-handcraft-to-industrial-core-primitive.name = Primitive Core
block.from-handcraft-to-industrial-core-primitive.description = A core made only from logs, with poor quality and weak defense, but at least it's a usable core.
block.from-handcraft-to-industrial-core-primitive.details = Acquire [yellow]stone blocks[] as soon as possible to make better [yellow]stone cores[].

# Wall
block.from-handcraft-to-industrial-log-wall.name = Rough Wooden Wall
block.from-handcraft-to-industrial-log-wall.description = A wall made of logs, but very fragile due to lack of processing.
